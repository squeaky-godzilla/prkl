## Docker (requires Docker, Docker Compose)
If you are able to run Docker on your machine, you can deploy the solution in containers. In real life, the MongoDB backend is probably not the best option - it is better to deploy it on a dedicated machine, with reasonably powerful storage subsystem. But for the purposes of the demonstration it's enough.

## Docker on Vagrant (requires VirtualBox, Vagrant, Ansible)
If you are unable to run Docker on your system directly, go and deploy it within a Vagrant VM.

## Vagrant VM based solution (requires VirtualBox, Vagrant, Ansible)
VM based deployment powered by Vagrant and Ansible
